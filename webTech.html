    <h1>Web Technology</h1>
    <h2>Html</h2>
    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
        web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
        such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        the appearance of the document.
    </p>
    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <.input /.>
            directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as  surround and provide information about
                document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use
                them to interpret the content of the page.
    <p>
      HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior
      and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
      Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has
      encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as
     HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the canvas element, in collaboration with
     javascript.

            <h2>Css</h2>
            <p> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide
                Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
                specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
                pages that share the file and its formatting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
                styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
                or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
                the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if
                more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

            <h2>Javascript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It
                is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
                application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard
                data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for
                I/O.

                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some
                servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

                Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
                languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
            <p>The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to
                non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[15]
                The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished
                browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[16][17]

                During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for
                dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web
                development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to
                Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the
                Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]

                Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax
                similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new
                language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a
                Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in
                December.[6][1][18]

                The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At
                the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was the hot new language, so Eich considered the
                JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.[19]

            </p>
            <p>JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops,
                switch statements, do while loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only
                had function scoping with var; then block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords let and
                const. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic
                difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements)
                to be omitted.[51]

            </p>
            <p>Weakly typed
                JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation
                used.[52]

                The binary + operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers. This is because
                the addition operator doubles as a concatenation operator
                The binary - operator always casts both operands to a number
                Both unary operators (+, -) always cast the operand to a number
                Values are cast to strings like the following:[52]

                Strings are left as-is
                Numbers are converted to their string representation
                Arrays have their elements cast to strings after which they are joined by commas (,)
                Other objects are converted to the string [object Object] where Object is the name of the constructor of
                the object
                Values are cast to numbers by casting to strings and then casting the strings to numbers. These
                processes can be modified by defining toString and valueOf functions on the prototype for string and
                number casting respectively.

                JavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the
                rules can be mistaken for inconsistency.[53][52] For example, when adding a number to a string, the
                number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a
                string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction.</p>
